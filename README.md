## About

Project Orione is an app dedicated to planetary travelers who want to know more about the objects they are visiting, in order to plan the solar system trip of their dreams. We have created an app that provides users with informative yet fun data regarding the planets they want to explore, from general information about the objects to the interesting places they can visit, to the list of exciting activities and adventures they can undertake, and also images of the planet they want to go to, all sourced from NASA's Planetary Photojournal. The app also comes with an A.I chatbot that can provide users with additional information regarding the planetary bodies they are interested in. We hope that users of our app don't just become more informed and educated about the planets that make up our solar system, but also gain a greater appreciation of our unique existence in the solar system, as well as in our universe. By introducing planetary science to users through this "travel website" format, we hope to bridge the metaphorical distance between us humans on Earth and our planetary neighbors. By presenting the planets and their information as a tourist attraction that you can visit, we hope to create a sense of "closeness" between users and the object they're studying, thus allowing them to understand the planet better and thus become more knowledgeable regarding the planets of our solar system
